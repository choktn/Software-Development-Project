Software Development Project
=========================
Description
-------------------
This group project incorporated the various aspects of the software development lifecycle. Here is a brief rundown of what we did in each phase:

1) Software Requirements - Stated overview of the application, use cases, requirements and definitions

2) Specification/Analysis Modeling - Data flow and UML class diagrams that goes over the entire flow of the application as well as individual use cases

3) Design Modeling - More diagrams, including Program Structure Diagrams, that detail the sequence and use cases of the application

4) Implementation - Programming of the application

5) Testing - Module testing the various aspects of the application to ensure they are working as intended

6) User Manual - Gives an overview of how the application works and how to install the application

As for the application itself, we decided to make an online banking website that allows you to do the basic functionalities of banking such as depositing, withdrawing and transfering. The application's frontend utilizes the Flask framework as well as HTML/CSS and the backend is written in Python with data stored with SQLite.
